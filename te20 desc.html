    <p>
        Captain Babar Azam had only reached double-figures once in the tournament prior to the semi-final, with a scratchy 25 against Bangladesh in the final group game his only sign of form.

        But a dropped catch by Devon Conway off the very first ball he faced gifted the skipper a chance, and he grabbed that opportunity, stroking seven fours en-route to a 30th half-century of his storied T20I career.
        
        With Babar finding form, Pakistan will be a worry for their opponents in the final, and his opening partner looks in decent nick too.
